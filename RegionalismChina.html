           <i> Provincial Regionalism, Discrimination, and Inequality between Henan, Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai </i>
          </p>
          <p>Department of Political Science at Georgia State University • April 2020</p>

<p>After Deng Xiaoping’s rise to power as the de facto leader of the
  Chinese Communist Party in 1978, China underwent a sweeping set of economic reforms that led to a set of 
  paradoxical transformations. The country experienced remarkable growth—9 percent annual GDP increases, rapid industrialization in once-poor rural areas—creating a reputation of a society propelled by the promise of prosperity. 
  But these reforms were not simply a shift in economic policy; they were the restructuring of the entire social and political order, pursuing political and social objectives, seeking to decentralize state authority, dismantle collective agriculture, 
  privatize state-owned enterprises, and, in the process, gradually transition toward a market-oriented economy. These reforms set the stage for China’s rise as a major global economic and political power. However, with this accelerated growth came significant challenges. 
  While some regions flourished, others lagged behind, and the benefits of said progress were unevenly distributed. As a result, inequalities grew, and regional divisions deepened, revealing the complex and fragmented nature of China’s rapid transformation.
</p>
    <p>Economic disparities between regions in China became more pronounced after Deng Xiaoping’s reforms in the late 1970s, particularly with policies to decentralize government and decollectivize agriculture. These reforms spurred unprecedented economic growth, but also deepened existing political, economic, and structural divides between rural and urban populations. The introduction of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) further amplified these disparities, as they were designed to attract foreign trade and investment but ended up concentrating wealth and development in select areas.
For the purposes of this investigation, we will focus on the SEZs of Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Shanghai, as well as the broader provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Henan, and Beijing. The differences between these regions extend beyond economic factors, encompassing political, linguistic, structural, and social dimensions.

    </p>
    <p>Since the implementation of Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, income inequality grew immensely in China. Prior to 1978 and these reforms, 
      income inequality as measured through the GINI coefficient was only 0.16, reflecting a relatively egalitarian distribution of wealth; 
      between 1980 and 2002, it rose from 0.3 to 0.55. This sharp increase, according to the IMF, has “rendered China among the most unequal
      countries in the world.” Income inequality between regions, most notably between coastal and inland regions, has only grown due to the
      rapid industrialization of South China, as well as “differences in education and the skill premium” and “structural factors such as 
      urbanization and population aging.” This growing inequality is not just a byproduct of economic stimulation but a direct reflection of 
      the structural fractures that lie at the center of China’s rapid growth.

    </p>
    <p>At the time of the reforms, China’s economy was still largely agrarian, so a pivotal step in the shift toward a 
      capitalist economy was the decollectivization of agriculture. This initiative set to divide control of farmland that was once farmed
      and profited from communally, in its place instituting a “reorganization of the internal management system of the communes through 
      the introduction of the contract system.” Essentially, control of the land was handed over to individual farmers, who were required 
      to give a portion of their crops to the government in exchange for their newfound autonomy. The decollectivization reforms led to a 
      notable 25 percent increase in agricultural production, along with a sharp rise in farmers’ incomes, driven by “increased procurement 
      prices.” However, the policy also exacerbated divisions within the rural and working classes. While it increased individual wealth for 
      a select few, it politically disenfranchised the peasantry, undermining their collective power. Some analysts argue that this move was 
      crucial to China’s transition to capitalism, as it “disempowered the peasantry” and reduced resistance to further reforms. Through 
      their “temporary income increase” and fragmentation of “collective economic interests,” the CCP was able to gain the peasantry’s 
      support for further future reforms and effectively eliminate “one big threat to the further transition to capitalism.” 

    </p>
    <p>In this transition towards capitalism, the decentralization of government was another critical move by the CCP, 
      not just for reshaping the economy but also for consolidating greater national power. On the surface, decentralization might appear
      to be the weakening of the central state, with local governments gaining more autonomy, but the reality is far more complex.
      As Cai & Treisman (2006) point out, the "powers ‘lost’ by Beijing are not necessarily gained by local governments." 
      The increasing complexity of China’s economy and society, driven by rapid modernization, has made it harder for any level of
      government to maintain comprehensive oversight and control. Decentralization, effectively, did not just redistribute power: 
      it disseminated it in a way that made governance less centralized and more fragmented, creating a system where the state’s ability 
      to manage and direct its own transformation became increasingly tenuous.
<p>
  However, the directive did grant greater powers to local governance, particularly in economic matters. The policy allowed 
  local governments to “experiment” with new approaches to governance, fiscal policy, and structural reforms, fostering 
  “healthy competition among cities” and encouraging “local innovation in the provision of public goods.” The emphasis on local government 
  came with the implementation of Special Economic Zones, which started with Guangdong and Fujian, “to exploit their proximity to Hong Kong 
  and Taiwan.” These zones lined the coast, particularly in southeastern coastal provinces like Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi. These 
  particular regions were able to take advantage of the Open-Door policy (1978) that emphasized the importance of Chinese markets’ 
  participation in the global economy and attracting foreign investment. 
</p>
    </p>
  <p>The Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were granted special rights to specifically attract foreign direct investment, 
    including greater autonomy in political and economic decision-making, lower tax rates, and the ability to freely engage in 
    “joint-venture contracts with foreign companies.” This special status allowed these zones to serve as testing grounds for 
    market-driven policies. Over time, the entire country “gradually opened up to foreign investments and trades, starting from coastal 
    provinces and gradually expanding to the central and the west.” 
  </p>
      Alongside this, the decentralization of government also extended to the fiscal system, particularly in southern Chinese provinces 
          and the SEZs. This shift led to significant prosperity and urbanization in these areas, but also exacerbated existing structural 
          and economic disparities between regions. Decentralization also prioritized local governments’ abilities to deliver “results over 
          rules,” which in turn created “a fertile environment for corruption,” possibly deterring “investment and...political order in 
          states with a strong development objective.”
    <p> 
        <p> Along with these significant topographical and governmental divides, another major disparity between north and south China is the linguistic one. 
            In the south, particularly in Guangdong (Guangzhou), Hong Kong, and Macau, Cantonese (Yue) is spoken by the majority of residents, as well as other minority dialects like Wu, Xiang, Gan, Hakka, and Min, while in the north, particularly in Beijing, Hubei, Henan, and Shandong, 
            Mandarin is spoken by the majority, “a mostly monoethnic population (92% Han vs. 8% of 55 other ethnicities).” This greatly hinders the ability to communicate between regions, since each dialect, particularly Cantonese and Mandarin, is nearly unintelligible to one another. So, linguistic north-south regionalism and categorization “may be explained by...the great variation in local dialects and accents which serve as the most easily recognized stigma of the people.” This, in turn, enhances stereotypes and tensions between the north and south, which are not only historically rooted in dynastic divides between the regions but are also magnified by the rapid industrialization and commercialization of the country.
        </p>
  <p>
  The decentralization of government also intensified the geographic divides between provinces, largely due to the increased authority of 
    local governments. One of the most significant divides between the  northern and southern regions of China is delineated by the 
    Qinling–Huaihe Line, which includes the Qinling mountains, the Huai River, and the Yangtze River. These natural topographic boundaries, 
    particularly the mountainous terrain, make it more physically difficult for inland provinces to reach trade at the coast quickly and to
    develop efficient transportation networks over such rugged landscapes. As a result, these geographic features have "sliced the country 
    in two economically." Western and inland provinces, in particular, face higher transportation costs due to their distance from the 
    coast and the challenging topography, leaving them at a distinct disadvantage in terms of trade and economic development.
        </p>
    <p>
      Geographic and topographic divides only magnified distance and disparity between inland and coastal provinces, 
      creating “certain adverse effects on [economic] growth.” The inland provinces, cut off from the coastline, faced 
      immense barriers in participating in the global market, especially Guangdong and Beijing. The Open-Door Policy, 
      which sought to exploit the geographical advantages of the coastal provinces to attract foreign investment, exacerbated 
      these divisions. It created a situation where industrialization and infrastructure flourished along the coast, while inland areas, 
      with their rugged terrain and distance from trade routes, were left behind.  
    </p>
    <p> 
       In addition to significant topographical and governmental divides, linguistic differences represent another major source of 
      disparity between north and south China.  In the south, particularly in regions like Guangdong (Guangzhou), Hong Kong, and Macau, 
      Cantonese (Yue) is the predominant language, alongside a range of other minority dialects such as Wu, Xiang, Gan, Hakka, and Min. 
      In contrast, the north, including Beijing, Hubei, Henan, and Shandong, is dominated by Mandarin, spoken by a largely monoethnic 
      population (92% Han vs. 8% of 55 other ethnic groups). This linguistic divide creates a significant barrier to communication between 
      regions, as Cantonese and Mandarin are often unintelligible to each other. Linguistic regionalism, in this case, is deeply tied to 
      social categorization, with dialects and accents serving as easily recognizable markers of identity. As such, the linguistic divide 
      further fuels stereotypes and tensions between the north and south—tensions that are not just historically rooted in the deep 
      dynastic divides between the regions, but also amplified by the rapid industrialization and commercialization of China. The uneven 
      development of these regions, combined with the linguistic barriers, has made the gulf between them even more pronounced, 
      contributing to a sense of regionalism that persists in modern China.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linguistic divides in China are often accompanied by deep social divides, many of which are rooted in the structural nature of 
          the government and institutions like the <i>hukou</i> system. The <i>hukou</i> is a residency (or household) registration system, under which 
          residents and families are classified as “rural” or “urban.” It is a “dualistic socioeconomic structure” under which “some 
          700-800 million people are in effect treated as second-class citizens.” Those with a "rural" hukou face significant restrictions, 
          including being unable to legally settle in cities and lacking access to basic welfare and state-provided services available to 
          urban residents. Before the reforms of 1978 and the subsequent wave of industrialization, most residents in southern and central 
          China, particularly those outside of cities, held “rural” classifications. This made it very difficult for interstate travel and 
          migration, which gradually opened up after 1978. 
        </p>
<p>
 Despite the loosening of migration policies after the reforms, rural workers who move to cities still face significant obstacles 
  in obtaining new residency classifications, access to welfare, education, and employment opportunities. Rural migrant labour 
  (nongmingong) specifically “...refers to industrial and service workers with rural hukou” and they are not considered officially to 
  be urban workers. As a result, this creates clear social divisions within provinces with high commercial output and large migrant labor 
  forces, such as Guangdong. These divisions not only separate ‘rural-to-urban’ populations within these regions but also set them apart 
  from the rest of the country. The hukou system exacerbates regionalism in China by compounding “the lack of redistribution within China’s 
  fiscal system.” Commercial, prosperous localities are prioritized by Beijing because of their “large amounts of fiscal revenue,” and “poor
  areas are left behind.”  
 
</p>            
  <p>
    In recent decades, the Chinese government launched several initiatives aimed at alleviating regional inequality and addressing 
    concerns over social and political instability  “...as a result of economic polarization.” One notable effort was the Western 
    Development Program (<i>xibu da kaifa</i>; WDP) of 1999. This program aligned with Deng Xiaoping’s proposal to reform and develop the nation in 
    stages, “first on the coast and then in the interior.” After nearly two decades of rapid development along the coast and in the eastern 
    provinces, the government turned its attention to the west, signaling a “change in China's regional development strategy,” 
    initiating the WDP as a way to narrow the growing disparities. The WDP set out to improve the infrastructure and industrial 
    production capabilities of western provinces, implementing “preferential policies for foreign investment and significant 
    increases in fiscal transfers to western regions.”

  </p>
<p>
  As a result, “the income gap between coastal and western regions has decreased since the mid-2000s.” But this shift is not merely an 
  economic balancing act; it is a response to a profound structural imbalance that emerged in the 1990s, when the southern and eastern 
  provinces of China saw expansive growth, fueled by international trade and investment. This rapid development along the coast generated 
  vast wealth but also magnified the disparities between the prosperous regions and the underdeveloped inland areas. 
  Due to these profound gaps in industrialization and economic prosperity between southern coastal provinces and western inland provinces, 
  the WDP “implemented strategic programs...and announced new incentives to attract investment to the central and western regions.”
</p>
<p>
  In 2008, about a decade after the WDP was first introduced, the government continued to set new initiatives for the development of 
  the western and central regions. From 2000 to 2008, following the implementation of the WDP, China’s western region’s collective GDP 
  grew by an average of 11.7 percent annually. However, the program and continued policies of the CCP are not without their own shortcomings;
  from 1999 to 2009, “high-volume growth in western China was limited to just three major cities: Chengdu, Sichuan; Chongqing; and Xi’an,” 
  and overall average incomes in the western and central regions were below the national average.

</p>
<p>
  The integration of capitalism and commercialism in China has exacerbated regional tensions, intensifying the very divides it 
  purports to address. The economic disparities between provinces remain glaring, particularly the chasm between rural and urban areas. 
  Initiatives like the Western Development Program (WDP) were designed to bridge these gaps, but the decentralized nature of governance 
  often undermines their effectiveness. The problem lies in the way local governments, with their patchwork of authorities and varying 
  levels of autonomy, can mismanage or distort the implementation of such programs. This makes it difficult to assess whether these 
  initiatives are truly achieving their intended goals. The real question, then, is not just whether China can manage these growing 
  divides, but whether it can ever reconcile the promises of progress with the entrenched reality of inequality.
