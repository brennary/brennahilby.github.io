          <h2>Regional Discrimination in China</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">
           <i> Provincial Regionalism, Discrimination, and Inequality between Henan, Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai </i>
          </p>
          <p>Department of Political Science at Georgia State University • April 2020</p>

    <p>After Deng Xiaoping’s rise to power as the de facto leader of the Chinese Communist Party in 1978, 
        China experienced a series of substantial economic reforms that consequently led to its substantial economic prosperity. 
        The country saw an annual per capita GDP growth rate reaching 9 percent, and many rural provinces became quickly industrialized. 
        These reforms were not solely economic, however, as many of these directives were also set to decentralize the government, decollectivize agriculture, privatize state enterprises, and, with that, gradually move towards a market economy. These reforms became the underpinning of China’s rise to the international stage as a major economic and political superpower; however, this rapid acceleration to power has also been met with parallel rises in divisions, inequalities, and regionalism between China’s provinces. 
    </p>
    <p>The most significant disparities between provinces can be seen particularly in Special Economic Zones (or SEZs) set forth to promote 
        foreign commerce during the implementation of these reforms. This paper will focus specifically on the zones of Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Shanghai, and more broadly, 
        the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Henan, Shanghai, and Beijing. The disparities between these particular zones and provinces are not only economic, 
        but also political, linguistic, structural, and social. Economic disparities between regions began to grow after the implementation of Deng Xiaoping’s string of reforms in the late 1970s, 
        particularly following policies to decentralize government and decollectivize agriculture. Both of these initiatives “...fueled an unprecedented period of growth that increased GDP per capita.” 
        However, they also intensified existing political, economic, and structural disparities between rural and urban populations. 

    </p>
    <p>Since the implementation of Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, income inequality has grown immensely in China. Prior to 1978 and these reforms, income inequality as measured through the GINI coefficient was only 0.16 because of egalitarian 
        income distribution; between 1980 and 2002, it rose from 0.3 to 0.55. This sharp increase, according to the IMF, has “rendered China among the most unequal countries in the world.” 
        Income inequality between regions, particularly coastal versus inland regions, has only grown due to the rapid industrialization of South China, 
        as well as “differences in education and the skill premium” and “structural factors such as urbanization and population aging.” 
        This inequality is a clear representation of regional disparities in China and how they continue to grow.
    </p>
    <p>At the time of the reforms, China’s economy was still largely based on agriculture. A significant move by the government in the shift towards a capitalist economy 
        was the decollectivization of agriculture. This initiative set to divide control of farmland that was once farmed and profited from communally, in its place instituting a 
        “reorganization of the internal management system of the communes through the introduction of the contract system.” 
        In short, this meant that farmers were given official control of their own land in exchange for a government-contracted portion of their crops. While the decollectivization of agriculture led 
        to an alleged 25 percent increase in agricultural production and greatly raised farmers’ incomes due to “increased procurement prices,” 
        it also divided the rural and working classes further by severely politically disempowering the peasantry.  Some argue that “decollectivization served as the political basis of the capitalist transitions in China” 
        because it “disempowered the peasantry” and “greatly reduced the potential resistance to reform.” Through their “temporary income increase” and fragmentation of “collective economic interests,” the CCP was able to gain the peasantry’s 
        support for further future reforms and effectively eliminate “one big threat to the further transition to capitalism.” In this further transition towards capitalism, the decentralization of government was an equally essential move by the CCP in not only changing the nature of the economy but also securing greater national power. Although decentralizing government on the surface would seem to be the “weakening of the central state apparatus” and the strengthening of local governments, it is not so cut-and-dry as this. According to Cai & Treisman (2006), “powers ‘lost’ by Beijing are not necessarily gained by local governments,” and the “increasing complexity of the Chinese economy and society as the country modernizes has made monitoring and control by any level of government less comprehensive.”
 
    </p>
    <p>However, the directive did grant greater powers to local governance, especially in an economic sense. The policy not only allowed local governments to “experiment” with new approaches to governance, fiscal policy, 
        and structural policy, but also encouraged “healthy competition among cities” and “local innovation in the provision of public goods.” The emphasis on local government came with the implementation of Special Economic Zones, 
        which started with Guangdong and Fujian, “to exploit their proximity to Hong Kong and Taiwan.” These zones lined the coast, particularly in southeastern coastal provinces like Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi. 
        These particular regions were able to take advantage of the Open-Door policy (1978) that emphasized the importance of Chinese markets’ participation in the global economy and attracting foreign investment. The Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were granted special rights to specifically attract more foreign direct investments, including higher autonomy in political and economic decision-making, lower tax rates, and the ability to freely engage in “joint-venture contracts with foreign companies.” Throughout this period, the whole country “gradually opened up to foreign investments and trades, starting from coastal provinces and gradually expanding to the central and the west.” The decentralization of government also decentralized the fiscal system, particularly in southern Chinese provinces and these SEZs, which in turn led to great prosperity and urbanization, but also led to greater structural and economic regional disparities. Decentralization also prioritized local governments’ abilities to produce “results over rules,” which in turn created “a fertile environment for corruption,” possibly deterring “investment and...political order in states with a strong development objective.”

    </p>
    <p>With the decentralization of government also came enhanced geographic divides between provinces, particularly because of the heightened authority of local governments. The north and south regions of China are split most significantly by the Qinling–Huaihe Line, made up of both the Qinling mountains and the Huai River, as well as the Yangtze River. These topographic boundaries, particularly the mountains, make it more difficult for inland provinces to quickly reach trade at the coast and to construct efficient transportation over rugged terrain, and have “also served to slice the country in two economically.” Inland, particularly western provinces, have suffered from “high transportation costs due to rugged topography” and disadvantages due to “sizable distance to the coast.”
        Geographic and topographic divides only magnified distance and disparity between inland and coastal provinces and “created certain adverse effects on [economic] growth.” The distance to the coastline became an issue for inland urban provinces seeking participation in the global market, and further raised fiscal, ethnic, and political tensions, particularly between south and north China, such as Guangdong and Beijing. The Open-Door Policy’s exploitation of coastal provinces’ geographical and topographical aspects in hopes of attracting foreign investment led to clear inequities in industrialization and transportation between urban and rural localities. 
        </p>
        <p> Along with these significant topographical and governmental divides, another major disparity between north and south China is the linguistic one. 
            In the south, particularly in Guangdong (Guangzhou), Hong Kong, and Macau, Cantonese (Yue) is spoken by the majority of residents, as well as other minority dialects like Wu, Xiang, Gan, Hakka, and Min, while in the north, particularly in Beijing, Hubei, Henan, and Shandong, 
            Mandarin is spoken by the majority, “a mostly monoethnic population (92% Han vs. 8% of 55 other ethnicities).” This greatly hinders the ability to communicate between regions, since each dialect, particularly Cantonese and Mandarin, is nearly unintelligible to one another. So, linguistic north-south regionalism and categorization “may be explained by...the great variation in local dialects and accents which serve as the most easily recognized stigma of the people.” This, in turn, enhances stereotypes and tensions between the north and south, which are not only historically rooted in dynastic divides between the regions but are also magnified by the rapid industrialization and commercialization of the country.
        </p>
        <p>With linguistic divides come social ones too, which are based particularly in the structural nature of the government and with institutions such as the hukou classification system. The hukou is a residency (or household) registration system, under which residents and families are classified as “rural” or “urban.” It is a “dualistic socioeconomic structure” under which “some 700-800 million people are in effect treated as second-class citizens.” Those with “rural” classifications can be “deprived of the opportunity to settle legally in cities and of access to most of the basic welfare and state-provided services enjoyed by regular urban residents.” Prior to the reforms of 1978 and subsequent industrialization, most residents in southern and central China, particularly those outside of cities, held “rural” classifications. This made it very difficult for interstate travel and migration, which gradually opened up after 1978. 
        </p>
        <p>Despite loosened migration policies after the reforms, when “rural” workers go to cities to work, they still face obstacles in gaining new residency classifications, access to welfare, education, and work opportunities. Rural migrant labour (nongmingong) specifically “...refers to industrial and service workers with rural hukou” and they are not considered officially to be urban workers. Consequently, this creates social divisions within provinces with high commercial output and migrant labor forces, such as Guangdong; they also divide these regions and these ‘rural-to-urban’ populations from the rest of the country. The hukou system magnifies regionalism in China by compounding “the lack of redistribution within China’s fiscal system.” Commercial, prosperous localities are prioritized by Beijing because of their “large amounts of fiscal revenue”, and “poor areas are left behind.”  The hukou system also intensifies income inequality between western and coastal regions, as well as between rural and urban populations within each region and province. 
        </p>
        <p>In recent decades, the Chinese government has set out to implement initiatives to address “...heightened concerns over social and political instability as a result of economic polarization” and to alleviate inequality, such as the Western Development Program (xibu da kaifa) of 1999. The program aligned with Deng Xiaoping’s proposal to reform and develop the nation in stages, “first on the coast and then in the interior.” After almost two decades of rapid development of the coastlines and eastern provinces, the party looked to the west and announced a “change in China's regional development strategy” and initiated the WDP.
            The WDP set out to improve the infrastructure and industrial production capabilities of western provinces, implementing “preferential policies for foreign investment and significant increases in fiscal transfers to western regions.”
            </p>
        <p>As a result, “the income gap between coastal and western regions has decreased since the mid-2000s.” In the 1990s, southern and eastern provinces experienced rapid economic growth and international commercial profit, and as a result, interregional and interprovincial disparities surged. Due to these extremely profound gaps in industrialization and economic prosperity between southern coastal provinces and western inland provinces, the WDP “implemented strategic programs...and announced new incentives to attract investment to the central and western regions.”
            In 2008, about a decade after the WDP was first introduced, the government continued to set new initiatives for the development of the western and central regions. From 2000 to 2008, following the implementation of the WDP, China’s western region’s collective GDP grew by an average of 11.7 percent annually. However, the program and continued policies of the CCP are not without their own shortcomings; from 1999 to 2009, “high-volume growth in western China was limited to just three major cities: Chengdu, Sichuan; Chongqing; and Xi’an,” and overall average incomes in the western and central regions were below the national average.
            </p>
        <p>The country’s integration of capitalism and commercialism has only escalated regionalist tensions. The economic disparities between provinces remain stark, particularly between rural and urban areas as well as between rural and urban residents. While broad programs like the WDP are effective on paper, the localized and decentralized nature of government throughout China can corrupt this effectiveness and the overall implementation of these types of programs. It’s honestly quite hard to say how effective they are at all, given that data from the CCP and its affiliates is historically and generally unreliable. It remains clear, however, that regionalism and provincial discrimination lead to further systemic, political, economic, and social issues for all of China.
