          <h2>Politics, the CCP, and everyday life in <i>Factory Girls</i> by Leslie T. Chang  </h2>
<p></p> 
<p>Factory Girls by Leslie T. Chang (2008) chronicles the lives, struggles, successes, and failures of young women working in the industrial city of Dongguan. It follows the stories of two women, Min and Chunming, who are migrants from Hunan province who came to Dongguan to work. In 1992, Min came to Dongguan to work at 16 (the legal age to work is 18) and got a job at an electronics factory; Chunming, as Chang puts it, “started out in a toy factory, was almost tricked into a brothel, talked her way into management, and struck it rich selling Tibetan medicine and funeral plots.” Both women move from job to job, find the courage to confront their management, and are eventually able to move up the ladder, all while trying to maintain a sense of normalcy as young women away from home. 
    Dongguan is a major manufacturing hub, a “prefecture-level” city of the Guangdong province, sitting just on the edge of the Pearl River Delta. In 2008, there were approximately 8 million residents, 5.2 million of whom were permanent migrants working in the city. Dongguan is well-known as a “factory city,” most of whose workers are migrant women from nearby villages or other cities in southern China. They migrate to the city despite the brutality of these factories and their conditions in hopes of not only bettering their financial situations but also in hopes of bettering their lives.
    </p>
    <p>Factory Girls details the ins and outs of Min and Chunming’s lives: their struggles, emotions, failures, and successes. Chang unveils not only the brutality of factory labor and its conditions but also the way it affects these women physically, mentally, and emotionally. The book reveals how they themselves, as migrant workers, view migration, factory work, and the city.  Chang also details a clear departure of these girls from generations past––within these women is a radical rejection of tradition replaced by dogged individualism and ambition, which in turn seems to further their sense of isolation from their families back home and from greater Chinese society. She describes their existence as being in a sort of “perpetual present” in which “making it in the city meant cutting ties to everything they knew.” While coming to work in a city like Dongguan is, on one hand, a financial decision, 
      it is also an emotional one––people want to better their lives, “find” themselves, secure their futures. 
        This “perpetual present” that persists throughout the novel tells a story of not only the emotional and financial landscape of these factory girls but also of how their relationship with greater Chinese society slowly fades as they continue their journeys deeper into the working world of Dongguan. Politics is rarely, if ever, at the forefront of their minds on a day-to-day basis. They are consumed by a grueling working life: earning the equivalent of $50 to $100 per month from 13-hour workdays on an assembly line, day-to-day dramas with colleagues, finding time for friendship and romance, all with one day off a week or none at all. It is a certain “coarseness of daily existence,” a “bleak world of complicated relationships, intense workplace politics, two-faced friendships, corrupt dealings, and status-conscious bosses with absolute power over one’s fate.”
        </p>
        <p>This “bleak world” is described by Chang in her discussion of Ding Yuanzhi’s Square and Round (1996), a book which was essentially a “point-by-point rejection of the virtues Chinese tradition had preached for two thousand years.” In it, Ding Yuanzhi provides a certain manual of “psychological manipulation” that helps one succeed in professional and personal spheres by way of using “pettiness, materialism, envy, competition, flattery, and subterfuge” to one’s advantage.
          This narrative reinforces the complete rejection of Confucian traditions by young migrant workers and the unyielding individualism, materialism, and ambition evident within them. It also gives a greater diagnosis of the workings of the city of Dongguan, which Chang describes as a “perverse expression of China at its most extreme,” plagued by “materialism, environmental ruin, corruption, traffic, pollution, noise, prostitution, bad driving, short-term thinking, stress, striving, and chaos.”
          </p>
          <p>The “chaos” of the rapidly developing city provided avenues for more corrupt and illicit industries to thrive, like the sex industry and pyramid schemes. These companies engaging in such schemes were typically denoted as chuanxiao companies, meaning “network sales,” which by definition “does not distinguish between legitimate direct sales and fraudulent pyramid schemes.” Even shady dealings can show up in the language. Eventually, the government caught wind of widespread chuanxiao operations in Dongguan and other cities across China and was worried about threats to the social and economic order. Once again, in their eyes, the “strain of China’s development” was rearing its ugly head against the rule of law. 
            While Beijing passed regulations and directives to see the chuanxiao industry controlled, local governments (like in Dongguan) rarely enforced these orders due to the  “tax revenue and employment to local areas” these companies brought, and also “partly because moonlighting as a chuanxiao distributor was a popular sideline for government officials.” 
            </p>
            <p>In 1998, Chunming lost her job at a chuanxiao company selling Tibetan medicine because of government directives to shut down all chuanxiao operations, and the “long arm of the government had touched her life, astonishingly, for the first time.” It is clear that for the most part, these girls’ everyday concerns are found in the “perpetual present” of working life and in their unrelenting anxieties surrounding poverty, job security, relationships, and family life. However, while the government is seemingly at the fringes of these girls’ daily lives, it is also, in many ways, at the center. While the CCP and its governance indirectly affect the way these women go and think about life, it is clear that the way virtually every structure, institution, and industry is set up and controlled is a result of the CCP’s governance. This includes how local government, economic zones, and infrastructure is set up, as well as how the province is governed, provided resources, etc.
              The rapid industrialization of Dongguan, for example, is a direct effect of CCP initiatives, particularly the Five-Year Plans that have been a cornerstone of the communist party’s governance in China since 1949. The Eighth Five-Year Plan (or “The Ten-year Layout for National Economy and Social Development and 8th Five-Year Plan”) was in effect during the time Factory Girls was written, which emphasized further infrastructural growth, economic reform, raised standards of living, and population control. This was a period of significant, almost unbridled, economic boom in China. The economy reached an annual growth of 11% between 1991 and 1995, and Dongguan’s motto was even “One Big Step Every Year, A New City in Five Years.”
              </p>
              <p>There is, however, a general attitude of disregard for southern provinces by Beijing and the political elites. Regional discrimination remains rampant within the government and Chinese culture, and as a result, there are discrepancies in resource allocation, education and work opportunities, and infrastructure improvement. This regional discrimination can also be attributed to both national and local governments ignoring (perhaps prejudicially) migrant populations and their needs, and “the government has been slow to acknowledge the reality of migration.” Dongguan local government even avoids reporting actual recorded numbers of migrants to “avoid paying higher taxes,” when their migrant population increases by about 1 million per year. There are even discriminatory laws that institute fines based on local income levels for violations of family planning policies, of which disproportionately affect southern provinces. 
              </p>
          <p>Migrants are regarded as a “floating population,” or liudong renkou, neither “rural” or “urban” workers within the Hokou residency classification system. According to Chang, the liudong renkou label  “suggests an aimless mob,” when in fact “most migrants leave home with a work objective in mind.” Most migrants do not obtain permanent urban residency when working in the city, generally living in the factories they work in until they are able to make enough money to have a place to live. This in-limbo existence contributes to difficulties migrant workers face when interacting with government entities, and even excludes them from most local educational resources and social welfare programs.
            This is just one of the ways the government and its structures deeply affect the lives of migrant workers. The Hokuo makes day-to-day life all the more difficult for those in rural areas or in southern provinces such as Guangdong, and can limit the job mobility and accessibility that Min and Chunming were able to eventually take advantage of. These two women, both with some education and business acumen, are able to take classes in their (limited) time off and use their savvy to get a leg up from job to job. This, of course, is not representative of every migrant worker in Dongguan. Some do not have time off at all, or have no avenues to get better educational or occupational resources, or have preexisting mental health conditions; the list goes on. 
            </p>
          <p>Factory Girls relays two women’s stories that have their fair share of coarseness, depravity, and struggle, but that also have adventure, hope, and redemption. Min and Chunming’s daily lives are fast-paced and “perpetually present,” sometimes plagued by corruption, deception, and isolation, and at other times filled with aspiration, love, and gratification. It is a human story, one of becoming an individual, of finding your path despite unfavorable odds and harrowing environments. “If it was an ugly world, at least it was their own.”
